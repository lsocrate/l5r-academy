# Dueling

Duels are a contentious part of L5R. Some people love them, some people hate them. We're not here to discuss if they're fun or not, but to learn tactics and strategies around them. How to use them to your advantage, and how to handle being on the other side of the blade.

The rules for initiating and resolving duels are described in the [Rules Reference Guide](https://www.emeralddb.org/rules/emerald#duel-timing). If you don't know how they work, go learn it first. Don't worry, this article will be here waiting.

## Cleaning up misconceptions

When you're first introduced to duels you might expect them to be very interactive and full of surprises and risks. After playing a few games you will probably learn the duels are pretty much the opposite, most of the time once a duel starts everybody kinda knows what will happen, almost no surprises there. Both things are true to different degrees. Duels are interactive and carry some risk, but that interaction and risk happens before the duel is called!

When someone challenges you to a duel, of course you will most probably lose that duel. Otherwise, why would your opponent waste a card on it? Cards are expected to work, if you suspect it will not work, you don't play that card. Simple.

Unless your _stronghold_ is `Kyuden Kakita`.

## Kyuden Kakita: the card that makes dueling weird

> **Kyuden Kakita**  
> _**Crane Stronghold.**_  
> **Reaction:** After a duel resolves, bow this stronghold and choose a character you control that was involved in the duel - honor that character.

The most common place where you will find duels is in `Kyuden Kakita` [KK]. That stronghold turns duels into means to and end. It allows the Crane player to trigger a duel that they don't care about winning or losing, all that matters is being able to trigger `KK` after to get honored, gaining those sweet skill bonuses and potentially enabling their `Voice of Honor`. You will find `KK` combined with cards like `Arrogant Kakita` and `Dazzling Duelist`: cards that bring cheap duels with effects that almost never matter, but those characters can honor themselves with `KK`. Win or low, no one cares. Honor tokens are the goal.

Kyuden Kakita is by far the most common stronghold where you will find duels being used. In the rest of this article, we will never go back to mention `KK` weirdness. It's usually pretty obvious when Crane is dueling just to trigger `KK`, keep that in mind. That said, `KK` doesn't change things too much, the rest of the tactics discussed here still applies.

## Duels beyond the basics

A Duel is an ability that balances this 3 elements:

```
       RISK
        .
       . .
      .   .
     .     .
    .........
CHAR         PLAYER
STATS        HONOR
```

If you have enough advantage in stats for the duel (5+), there's no risk, as even on a 5-1 bid the opponent would not reach your duelist.  
If you have enough honor advantage and a little bit of stats, the risk is also low as you can bid high to guarantee the duel victory.

Of course, if you're always minimizing risk by paying honor in high bids, soon that honor advantage will be gone: either the opponent gets close to honoring out, you gets close to losing the game by dishonor. It can be hard to get enough Stats advantage to overwhelm the opponent, most of the time you might get some amount of honor being transfered during a duel, specially when it is a duel where losing carries big consequences.

The duel player will try to maximize their skill advantage as often as possible, because it is the cheapest way of covering the Risk of dueling. But sometimes that cannot be done well, and that's where honor comes into play.

## How to avoid duels

If you know what duels to expect in a conflict (check the cheatsheet later in this article), you can make sure to only declare character into that conflict that have a dash on the skill used by those duels. Are you afraid of `Duel to the Death`? Send only your `Bayushi Liar`, or `Naive Student` into the conflict. Maybe your top priority is to not let the opponent play `Return the Offense`? Send only your `Moto Horde` to block, and leave your `Nimble Noyan` at home. Removing the targets for the duel is the most guaranteed way to not get duelled. Sometimes it's worth **not** defending at all and accepting the province break, instead of trying to defend and risking the duel.

Another approach is preparing your characters with attachments and other skills bonuses (or penalties on the duelist) before actually going into the conflict. Sure, plre-playing cards is inefficient, but in certain matchups it is and effective strategy. If you commit to the conflict already carrying some skill advantage, you gain an opportunity to play catch-up during the conflict while the duelist tries to raise their Stat enough to get confident in dueling.

Combine those strategies with making the honor trade riskier, either by the threat of dishonor win or honor win, and predicting the duels gets a lot more efficient.

And if you hate duels enough, there's `Stay Your Hand`. It's a decent card, that might fit your meta well.

## How to duel

You want your characters to be consistently big in whatever Stat your duels use. Gain those stats through honor tokens, attachments, and any other permanent sources of bonuses that you can find. Relying on in-conflict bonuses to enable your duels gets expensive quickly. It also makes the duel extra risky, as you need to commit your character first, then hope you get enough bonuses for it, but every time you use an action to get some bonus you're giving time to your opponent to react by canceling that effect or doing something else that gets rid of the duelist completely like a Send Home or some Kill effect.

Duels are naturally defensive abilities. This comes from them requiring compatible characters on both side of the conflict. When you defend, you who the attacker are, so you can choose knowing how they will match. But when you attack, it's harder to know who will defend. This rewards a slower rythm of play, as usually you will use your weaker characters on a first attack, to keep you best duelist ready to defend. Your best character will probably attack last in the round, if at all.

When you combine the slower defensive rythm, with the need of investing attachments in your characters, you get a strategy that naturally favors a Tall playstyle where you buy one main character, who costs 3 fate or more (to avoid assassination) and who receives enough fate to make the later investments worth it (so you add 3 fate or more on top of that character). You might still get a few smaller character here or there, but your main duelists are built slowly.

## Duels you must know

The duels (and related) that you **must** be aware of, what to consider against them, and if you flip it around, how to use them:

- `Defend Your Honor`: one of the most widely accessible cancels in the game. If your defense depends on an event going through, you might want to skip assigning defenders. Watch out for when a Keeper role opponent suspiciously move into a conflict a bowed character with high Military skill, they might be doing it to turn this on.
- `Duel to the Death`: you cannot refuse this duel if `Steward of Law` is in the conflict, if Steward appears watch out.
- `Return the Offense`: the standard anti-bow from Crane. A good reason to not send token defenses when Crane attack you.
- `Kakita Dojo`: the loser only bows if the winner is a Duelist. This assimetry makes this one of the best duels in the game, as very few Duelists exist outside Crane. If Crane loses this duel, usually nothing bad happens to them.
- `Duelist Training`: the honor trade in this duel can be paid with cards from the loser's hand. This can be extremely important in some scenarios, but usually you want to pay with honor.
- `Storied Defeat`: a common follow up for low-stakes duels.
- `Loyal Challenger`: it works to blank the opponent's characters, but scorpion will also challenge bigger opponents with it as a way of blanking itself to avoid the honor loss cause by the character's static ability.
- `Niten Pupil`: the doubled skill effect lasts the whole phase. Watch out for it being used together with an Elegant Tessen later. Also, Togashi Yokuni is a scary guy when he copies this.
- `Hida Yakamo`: Crab can overbid in a duel as a way of reaching lower honor, thus avoiding the duel effects.
